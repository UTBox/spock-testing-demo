# Synacy Graduate Program Exercise 1

### Instructions:
- Make sure to branch out from “synacy-grad-program-2024-exercise-1” branch
- Your branch name should be: “synacy-grad-program-2024-exercise-name” (e.g. synacy-grad-program-2024-exercise-steven)
- Write unit tests for the public methods in the `com.synacy.gradprogram.spock.exercise.OrderingService` class using the Spock test framework with Groovy
  - To run the tests, you can use this command: `./gradlew test`
- Included in this project is a sample Spock test class `com.mechanitis.demo.spock.ExampleSpecification` that you can use as a reference. Or you can refer to the "Spock Testing Tutorial" below to learn more.
- Once you are done adding the unit tests, create a pull request to merge your branch to the “synacy-grad-program-2024-exercise-1” branch


# Spock Testing Tutorial [![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

Simple project to show how to use Spock to test Java code.

This code was the basis for the JetBrains [IntelliJ IDEA Spock tutorial video](https://youtu.be/i5Qu3qYOfsM). The code may not be exactly the same as in the video, but the examples are aligned. 

Download this code and play with it to see what Spock might offer you.
